# Data

This folder contains data to be used by CubeSLAM.

## ORB Vocabulary
ORB data to be used by the base ORB-SLAM2 system either as text (`ORBvoc.txt`) or binary data
(`ORBvoc.bin`). The former can be retrieved from [here](https://github.com/raulmur/ORB_SLAM2/blob/master/Vocabulary/ORBvoc.txt.tar.gz) while the latter is just its binary representation using
[this pull request](https://github.com/raulmur/ORB_SLAM2/pull/21).
